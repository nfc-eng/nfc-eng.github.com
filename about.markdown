My name is Nicholas Clement and I am a Software Engineer at AWS.

This blog is to serve as a knowledge repository of different problems I have solved or encountered, and help myself and others remember how to solve them if they recur. 

Currently, I am a SDE at Amazon Web Services, in my day to day work I am mostly focused on software that helps us maintain our data-centers.

In my free time, myself and [Brennon Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brennon-lee-b7a355117/) work on a website called [HottestHappyHours](https://hottesthappyhours.com/)

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-clement-2b3606114/), or follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/nfc-eng).
